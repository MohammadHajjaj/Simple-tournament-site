# Simple tournament
A simple tournament website using php and css I made long time ago, originally made for a small local csgo tournament  

# How to set it up
Create a database called 'tournament'  
Import tournament.SQL  
Configure your database details and the admin user in includes/database.php  

# Todo 
1- generate a bracket depending on the teams that registered  
2- make a page where captains can veto maps
